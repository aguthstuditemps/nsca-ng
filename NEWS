Changes in release 0.2 (2013-02-19, unpublished):

  - Accept non-numeric service check result status when matching against
    service patterns.

    when service patterns without host name part were specified.
  - Mention the session ID when refusing data.
  - Fix the client's `-s' option.  It was effectively ignored.
  - Don't link the client against the libraries used only by the server.
